The plan in my mind is to generate realistic enough data for further coding with procedures, since its very inconvenient to write procedures without data, without knowing if its truly working.
After that coding packages to create more logic to the data model. 

Now main point is to sort out data struggle and then move onto next steps.


Decided to stop with the Copilot, since its not really beneficial for me to use it extensively like that.
Waiting for mentors word.
